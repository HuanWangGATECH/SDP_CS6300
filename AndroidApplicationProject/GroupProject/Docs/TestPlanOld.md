# Test Plan

**Author**: Team28

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

We will establish test objectives for the entire app before implementing them. Testing will be divided into components and performed in phases: Unit, Integration and System Testing. Each test phase will ensure complete test coverage. Each test case implementation will be verified for correctness, robustness and functionality. Regression testing will be performed several times to check against feature changes and for design robustness. Developers who do not design the software component will design the black box test of the that component, otherwise, he/she will design the white box test.

### 1.2 Test Selection
##### Unit Testing

* uses Junit to test a class' own private method (unit tests for individual each class)
* any invalid inputs should be handled (bounds checking, null, other exceptions)
* operation logic is validated (multiple test cases for assertions)

##### Integration Testing:

* Will use Junit to test class relationships with one another
* Will use both private and public methods of classes (tests will group components together)

##### System Testing:

* Will use Espresso to simulate user behavior by constructing test that combine the system as a whole (both back-end and front end)
* Handling other unexpected behaviors such as providing UI feedback (errors, navigation etc) as well as:
	* Stress and performance tests: How will system handle the display of 1000 quizzes in a list and their associated scores?
	* Security testing: Ensure user cannot break inputs such as SQL injecting, inputting invalid characters that may crash app into textEdit fields
	* Recovery testing: How will the app recover from an error instead of crashing; Provide helpful user crash/error messages

##### Regression Testing:

* Will use a combination of manual and automated testing: Automated testing will perform a majority of the test workload (maybe 90% automated vs 10% manual)
* We will re-run an entire suite against each new build to make sure previous features did not break

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion
* In order to have good quality of the test plan, the android studio code coverage will be use as reference for our test case coverage. We will cover test cases which consider reasonable corner cases. Additional test cases will be added throughout the test cycle.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking
* Bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked using a tracking suite such as JIRA or simply documenting it on GitHub Issues
* Inline TODO comments will be used to track bugs with a short description and a URL linking back to the JIRA discussion or Github Issues page

### 1.5 Technology
* For unit tests and integration tests we intend to use JUnit
* For System tests we intend to use Espresso

### 2 Test Cases
* Note: UX = Unit Tests and IX = Integration Tests*
