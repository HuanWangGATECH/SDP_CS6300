* **Post-Conditions:** Student content is added to the database and they navigate back to the main login screen
* **Scenarios:** At the main login screen new users must create an account by clicking on the **Create an Account** link found below the login form. The screen will navigate to the registration screen. The registration form will have multiple fields followed by a **Register** button at the bottom. The user can input their desired username, email, full name, major and seniority level then click on the register button which will display errors if any are found. If no errors exist then a success toast message will appear and shortly return back to the login screen.

* **Scenarios:** User will enter their username in the **Username TextEdit Field** and click the **Login** Button. If the username does not exist then an error will be displayed. However, if the username does exist in the database then they will be directed to the Apps Home Page. Here the user will have options to create/ remove a quiz and take quizzes made by other students and view the quizzes corresponding score statistics.

This screen will contain a form specifically for the quiz class which multiple fields: title (serving as the unique name), quiz description (displayed when users view the quiz), words and their definitions along with a list of incorrect definitions and lastly a **Create Quiz** button. Because a quiz can only have 1 to 10 words, it will initially have one word and definition section with a **+** Button to add additional words. Each word definition pair added will add 3 additional incorrect fields below it. This **+** button disappears when we reach the maximum of 10 words. Each word and corresponding definition can be removed by swiping them from right to left.

## Practice Quiz
* **Description:** Students can take a quiz from a list of quizzes which they are not an author of

* **Scenarios:** At the home page, the user can select a quiz from the list presented to them. Tapping on a quiz in the list will bring up a new screen which displays information of the quiz such as the author, highest and first scores by that student and top 3 perfect scores by other students displaying their username/name alphabetically. There will also be a **Take Quiz** Button (if user is not the author). When users click the **Take Quiz** Button the screen will transition to the quiz screen which will then display all the generated questions to the user. Generated questions are composed of a random word with the correct definition and 3 randomly selected definitions from the list of definitions. Users can tap on each definition which instantly shows Incorrect Or Correct. When there are no more words left to be displayed, the quiz is immediately graded. This score is then displayed to the user in a **Scorescreen** and stores the score for that quiz and student. Below this screen will have a **return home** button. Clicking this button will navigate the user back to the home page where they can once again take another quiz.
